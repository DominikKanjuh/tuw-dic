# Data-intensive Computing - Chi-square Term Selection with MapReduce

This repository contains the project for the Data-intensive Computing (194.048) course at TU Wien during the Summer 2025 semester.

The project implements a MapReduce pipeline using Python's `mrjob` library to compute chi-square statistics for unigram terms in the [Amazon Review Dataset (2014)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon/links.html), facilitating term selection for text classification.
